--------------------------------------------------

1. [INC-0364] NUMERICAL INCONSISTENCY
   Slides: 1, 2, 3, 4
   Confidence: 95.0%
   Description: Inconsistent time savings calculations. Slide 1 & 2 state 15-20 minutes saved per slide. Slides 3 & 4 detail monthly savings, but don't connect to the per-slide savings.
   Suggested Action: Reconcile the per-slide time savings with the monthly time savings. Provide the number of slides created per month to justify the calculations.
   Details:
     slide1_savings: 15 mins/slide
     slide2_savings: 20 mins/slide
     slide3_monthly_savings: 10+12+8+6+4 = 40 hours
     slide4_monthly_savings: Implies 40 hours from slide 3

2. [INC-0368] NUMERICAL INCONSISTENCY
   Slides: 7
   Confidence: 95.0%
   Description: Inconsistent time units for saved time: hours/month vs. hours/year.

   Details:
     Automated Content Generation: 12 hours saved per consultant/month
     Streamlined Chart/Table Creation: 8 hours saved per consultant/month
     Layout Optimization: 72 hours saved per consultant/year
